# CPP-Microprojects
I'm working on learning C++, and I don't want it to look like I'm neglecting programming. Rather than exclusively publishing bigger projects, I plan to start adding my smaller projects as well. I don't want a thousand differet repositories for microprojects, so I plan to house all of them here.
